WiFi Gateway for MySensors network

Arduino sketch and PCB for an ESP8266 based WiFi Gateway for MySensors network (NRF24)</br>
It uses a Wemos D1 mini and a NRF24L01+ module boards</br>
It uses a mains power supply

It fits perfectly in a small and low cost enclosure from  SUPERTRONIC reference PP73N :</br>

Note that in this PCB the Wemos module is mounted with</br>
-ESP WiFi module bottom side</br>
-CH340 & USB upper side</br>
This is the opposite side of common usage, but it greatly ease the use of the USB connector</br>
This is easily done since the Wemos D1 mini module comes with unsoldered breakout pins</br>
Take care when soldering the wemos D1 mini's breakout pins to solder them accordingly to the PCB layout of this repository</br>
